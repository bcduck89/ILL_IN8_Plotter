Title: Investigation of topological phonon dispersion in ß-Ga2O3 single crystals

Abstract
In recent years, there has been growing interest in multi-gap topology, which has the potential for applications,
such as in quantum computing. Unlike single-gap topology in quantum materials, multi-gap topology is known to be
observable in the bosonic spectrum, and indeed we have theoretically predicted the existence of topological phonons
around 57 meV along Gamma-X-Gamma trajectory in ß-Ga2O3 using machine learning force fields (MLFF) with beyond
density functional theory (DFT) accuracy. By mapping out the dynamical structure factor across the predicted Dirac point
and together with the computational analysis, we would be able to determine the topological invariants in the ß-Ga2O3 system.
Therefore, we apply for 7 days of beamtime at the thermal TAS IN8.
